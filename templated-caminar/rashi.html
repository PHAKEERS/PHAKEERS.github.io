					<h2>Introduction to Data-Structures</h2>
					<p></p>
				</header>
				<div class="content">
					<p>Data Structure is a way of collecting and organising data in such a way that we can perform
						operations on these data in an effective way. Data Structures is about rendering data elements
						in terms of some relationship, for better organization and storage. For example, we have some
						data which has, player's name "Virat" and age 26. Here "Virat" is of String data type and 26 is
						of integer data type.</p>
					<p>If you are aware of Object Oriented programming concepts, then a class also does the same thing,
						it collects different type of data under one single entity. The only difference being, data
						structures provides for techniques to access and manipulate data efficiently.

						In simple language, Data Structures are structures programmed to store ordered data, so that
						various operations can be performed on it easily. It represents the knowledge of data to be
						organized in memory. It should be designed and implemented in such a way that it reduces the
						complexity and increases the efficiency.</p>

						<h3>Arrays</h3>
						<p>An array is a data structure that contains a group of elements. 
						Typically these elements are all of the same data type, such as an integer or string. 
						Arrays are commonly used in computer programs to organize data so that a related set 
						of values can be easily sorted or searched.</p>

						<h3>Tree</h3>
						<p>A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays,
						linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures.
						A tree can be empty with no nodes or a tree is a structure 
						consisting of one node called the root and zero or one or more subtrees.</p>

						<h3>Graph</h3>
						<p>A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.
						The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are 
						lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. </p>

					<div class="inner">
						<h3>Linked List</h3>
						<p>A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a 
						separate object.
                        Linked list elements are not stored at contiguous location;
						the elements are linked using pointers.

                        Each node of a list is made up of two items - the data 
						and a reference to the next node.
                        The last node has a reference to null. 
						The entry point into a linked list is called the head of the list.
						It should be noted that head is not a separate node,
						but the reference to the first node.
						If the list is empty then the head is a null reference..</p>
